PROBLEM: the player hands were being instantiated but then registered as null when sent through send info
SOLUTION: It turns out you can't use a for each loop to instantiate objects, but must instead use a regular for loop
            the hands were being only instantiated in the limited scope of the for each loop and were not being permenantly
            instantiated in the gameState

PROBLEM: sometimes the computerplayer will be making its first move but will have 12 cards instead of 13
SOLVED:  Samuel corrected the logic for Computer players determining if it was their turn to play a card

PROBLEM: switching the "leading player" is challenging because sometimes the computer player will sometimes think it is
        playing second or third if it is supposed to be leading.
SOLUTION Samuel made the turnInTrick variable equal to the number of cards in play
